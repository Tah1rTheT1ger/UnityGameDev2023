Boss Fight:
	The boss in our game has three types of attacks in its arsenal. The boss locks onto the player and uses one of the 3 attacks randomly. We used the sprites for the boss from the website https://www.spriters-resource.com/.

		Dashes the Player sliding itself towards the player.

	Sphere Attack;
		Jumps and forms a Sphere around itself which protects it and also attacks the player.
